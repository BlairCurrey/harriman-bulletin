        <p>
            The essential story I'm telling is what is happening in Harriman State Park. 
            The purpose of my website is to create content (news, pictures, videos, data)
            which connects people to Harriman State Park. The park is the closest natural oasis 
            to New York City and is a very popular destination for outdoors enthusiasts who 
            want to escape the city. I enjoy reading about people's knowledge and experiences 
            in the park, but there is not much of this content online, nor anywhere that 
            is particularly designed to deliver it. This newsletter serves to address this demand
            that I anticipate exists beyond myself given the park's high attendance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The newsletter is only seasonally updated because the topic by its nature is fairly slow
            to change. The structure of my website is like an online magazine. The home page  is like 
            the cover which introduces users to the site and features a preview of the contents (the report
            cards) as well as an intriguing feature (see: featured landmark) each edition. From here visitors
            can jump off into the different reports: weather, terrain, and wildlife. Each section briefs the
            reader on the state of these aspects, new developments, and long-term trends, as well as serving 
            as a place to publish interesting videos and pictures from the park. As an example of such media, 
            I included a video of one of many young Eastern Newts I encountered on a recent hike. Finally, I 
            included an "About" section to give the reader more information about the site, the theoretical 
            group that publishes it, and the park. In addition to the reports, there are more direct calls 
            for the reader to connect with the park. These include the button on the featured landmark section
            which takes the user to the landmark's coordinates in google maps and the directions to, and map of, 
            Harriman state park in about.html. Through these calls to explore the park, as well as the reports, 
            I think my structure achieves the goal of connecting people to Harriman State Park.

            <p>
                I have a trail map of the park which has the interesting feature of listing 
                different points of interest. These things include old mines, interesting rock
                formations, or scenic views. I like to scan for these features and then make a
                point to discover them. I wanted to translate that experience to the newsletter 
                so I created the featured landmark section which displays a new notable location 
                every edition. This hopefully compels the reader to explore the park.

            <p>
                The Boundary Waters Canoe Area is vast wilderness in Northern Minnesota. It is
                a popular destination for many outdoor enthusiasts and has a very active message
                board. The message board influenced the purpose of this site. I have used the BWCA
                forum to get seasonal information (water levels, bear activity, etc.) while planning
                trips. They also have a section for trip reports. This is the sort of information I
                want to make available to those interested in visiting or even just reading about
                Harriman.

            <li>Modern Web Dev Motifs</a></li>
            <p>
                I was largely happy with my midterm project but I was not satisfied with one aspect: the
                visual aesthetic. I wanted to draw inspiration from more modern web design motifs that
                I have noticed and appreciated as a user, some of which are exemplified in this article, 
                <a href="https://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/06/09/7-pillars-of-minimalist-web-design/">7 Pillars of Minimalist Web Design</a>. 
                These include using lots of negative space, predominantly black
                and white color scheme decorated with small amounts of bright color, and plain sans-serif 
                fonts. The cartoony media is much simpler and less detailed than pictures which also supports
                this design pattern.
            </p>
            <li>My interest in the outdoors</li>
            <p> 
                More than anything, I was inspired to make this newsletter by my interest in the outdoors. Exploring
                the wilderness by nature is not something done in large, organized groups. I think this is one reason why
                there isn't much of a community or meeting place for people that enjoy Harriman park (despite it being
                very close to the United State's largest urban center and having very high attendance). Although the park
                is so close to myself and so many other people, responsibilities keep me from visiting and exploring as
                often as I'd enjoy. So, my desire to have some connection to the park and knowledge of the natural undulations
                while at home is probably the largest influence.

    <div id ="accessible-response" class ="response">
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully defined alt text for all images and titles for iframes</li>
            <p>
                The alt text for images and titles for iframes elements give a clear, concise indication
                of the media for those using screen readers. Some of my alt text is not static, but inside
                of my handlebars templates. I made sure all of these dynamically defined pictures also had 
                alt text that matches them instead of having something generic that covers all of them. In
                these cases, the alt text is defined along with the image path in order to render the
                template. This meets <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content">
                criteria 1.1.1 of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.</a>
            </p>
            <li>Link text carefully defined</li>
            <p>
                I wanted to make sure my links supported cases where the user is using a screen reader to generate a list of links
                to navigate the site. As a result, all of my link text is both concise and descriptive. When a user generates a list
                of links they will know what each link is by the link text and they will be convenient to navigate by.
                This meets <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#link-purpose-link-only">

            </p>
            <li>Appropriate use of tables.</li>
            <p>
                Ensured table was accessible by clearly defining header cells with <code>&ltth&gt</code> and data cells with <code>&lttd&gt</code>. 
                Additionally, tables were not misused for making the layout of the website. This is in accordance with
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/tips/">the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines tutorials on tables.</a>
            </p>
            <li>Appropriate use of roles. </li>
            <p>
                Initially added <code>role="alert"</code> to the bear warning in wildlife.html not realizing that it would mislead
                users using assistive technology. I included it because I was using the built-in bootstrap alert styling so I thought 
                the alert role would also be appropriate. While the styling is appropriate, I was reviewing the accessibility of my 
                site and realized that this role falsely suggests there is an urgent matter regarding the use of the website. While 
                bear sightings are urgent for park visitors, they are not for website viewers. This realization caused me to re-examine
                my use of roles in general and I found other opportunities for improvement such as adding the button role to the 
                <code>&lta&gt</code> element in the featured landmark handlebars template. This is in accordance with
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles">the MDN Web Docs article on roles.</a>
            </p>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Additionally, the page is readable due to the very high contrast ratio of black text on a white background and the site
            layout scales well to desktop, tablet, and mobile.

            <li>Handlebars</li>
            <p>
                After learning about handlebars in class I realized that it could empower me to reuse code and take the details of
                the content out of HTML. I began by rewatching the handlebars lectures on coursera but realized they did not
                answer all my questions about handlebars. Namely how do I use partials and do I need them? Should I pre-compile my templates?
                How do I separate the javascript from the html document? I referenced the handlebars documentation<a href="#c1"><sup>1</sup></a>, 
                a blog post <a href="#c2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and a stack overflow post<a href="#c3"><sup>3</sup></a>, to learn how to pre-compile templates, to determine that I didn't 
                need to use partials for my use-case, and how to use simple logic and looping to dynamically render the html depending on what is in the data structure (display picture if present, display each paragraph instead of a set number, etc).
                To implement the actual precompilation and update my code, I followed the steps outlined in another Stackoverflow post refactored my code similarly.<a href="#c4"><sup>4</sup></a>
            </p>
            <li>Jquery</li>
            <p>
                From my understanding, jquery is the most common method for DOM manipulation so I wanted learn how to use it. 
                I utlized the w3schools<a href="#c5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the jQuery documentation<a href="#c6"><sup>6</sup></a> to learn how to select elements by element type, id and class, 
                how to append html into an element, filter list items, trigger events, bind methods on mouse hover, identify parent elements, and add classes.
                I found jQuery fairly easy to work with. The jQuery selectors are essentially the same as CSS which made that portion of referencing the DOM easy.
                The harder part was finding the names of the functions that performed what I wanted to do. However after googling for people trying to do similar things,
                I could usually find the relevant function fairly quickly and the documentation is very thorough which simplified implementing them.
            </p>
            <li>Bootstrap</li>
            <p>
                I had never used a framework before and decided I would try one for this project. I picked bootstrap because it was mentioned in class,
                it strongly emphasizes responsiveness and mobile sizing, and the style appeared to be easily adaptable to meet my goal of a modern,
                minimalist style.
            </p>
            <p>
                More specifically, the main thing I needed to learn was how to manipulate the layout and how to leverage and tweak the built-in style of
                bootstrap. To this end, I followed the w3 tutorials<a href="#c7"><sup>7</sup></a> for bootstrap and referenced the bootstrap documentation<a href="#c8"><sup>8</sup></a>. 
                This enabled me to implement most of the my website, but I needed to adapt one of the card templates from the bootstrap website
                for the featured landmark portion of the index.html page <a href="#c9"><sup>9</sup></a>. I based my section off the template with 
                considerable modifications. First, I split the body of the card and added a picture to the side. I also removed the "card-body" class
                and wrapped the split body into a new div with different classes ("row", "no-gutters") which gave me the correct spacing. The source I
                adapted this code from is also included in the html comments.
            </p>
            <li>Setting Nav Menu to Active page</li>
            <p>
                I wanted to highlight the nav item corresponding to the current page. I knew I could use the active tag to access the bootstrap
                styling but wanted to do better than hardcoding it manually on each page. Additionally, hard-coding it would not be an option
                when I later moved the navbar to a template. I referenced a post on the subject from CSS tricks <a href="#c10"><sup>10</sup></a> but
                improved it so that it would also work with relative and absolute hrefs, as well as highlight the parent element of the dropdown
                menu. The source code this was adapted from is included in the html comments.
        </ol>
    </div>
    <!-- What Worked Well -->
    <div id ="worked-prompt" class ="prompt">
        <h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? </h3>
    </div>
    <div id ="worked-response" class ="response">
        <p>
            I think the handlebars templating worked well because it allowed me to easily reuse a lot of the same code.
            I took advantage of this by using it for the navbar and footer on every page as well as the articles on the
            weather, terrain, and wildlife pages. I was even able to set up the article template such that it would
            work if you added additional paragraphs to the data object and regardless of whether or not their was a picture.
            So while the template ensures uniformity, it also has enough flexibility to handle such differences between articles.
            While this edition's wildlife report has an article and video, we might have news are or a data table that we want to 
            include in the next edition. With templates, we can simply create a data object with the information we want inserted 
            into the template and then inject the rendered template into the appropriate html element. In this way, we can modify 
            the content of the reports according to what we want to communicate that edition without changing the base html structure.
            Additionally, precompiling prevents this burden on the client and it doesn't require the increased size of the 
            run-time version of the handlebars library.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing that worked well was the decision to use bootstrap in terms of making the website responsive. Towards the end of
            the project I noticed the map in the about page and the table in the weather page were not scaling on mobile. As a result, the
            navigation links were pushed far off to the right. It broke the layout. Fixing this with boot strap was easy - all I need to
            do was change the classes ("table-responsive", and "embed-responsive") of the parent elements and the problem was fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I was pleased with the effect I created with the report cards. That is, when hovered over, the change from a static
            picture to a gif. I think this helps make the website feel more responsive and keeps the user engaged.
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Areas for Improvement -->
    <div id ="improvement-prompt" class ="prompt">
        <h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h3>
    </div>
    <div id ="improvement-response" class ="response">
        <p>
            One of the things that I could improve is to make the "subscribe" button functional. It currently brings up a form in a modal
            but nothing happens when you click the subscribe button. In theory this could enter the email into a database which is referenced
            every time a new edition is published to send out an email that notifies the recipient that the site is updated.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could add a lot more entries for the "featured landmarks" section to choose from. Right now it is more of a proof of concept,
            but the idea is that it could pull from a very large selection of curiosities in the park. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I could add a feature for the current weather. The solutions I found in a prelimanary search were to add a pre-styled widget
            from different weather sites but they neither fit thematically or really displayed the information that I wanted.
